	<p>
	I think I've finally finished everything. I had a lot of trouble intially finding parts for the new PC, especially the graphics card, but unfortunately my bad luck didn't end when all of my parts were ordered. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	See, a few weeks ago, I was ready to build. I had everything layed out on my table, including my old PC, that I was ready to gut and transfer to my new case along with some shiny new parts. After gutting my entire PC (except for the I/O panel, which I annoyingly realized after I had already reboxed my old motherboard), I started assembling the new one. Except, the PSU was about a millimeter too big for the new case. Now I was PC-less, and that lasted about two weeks. Great start.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Next, I grabbed a new PSU from the local computer shop (important to support local business, plus I didn't want to wait for a delivery) and finally assembled my new computer about two weeks after the initial attempt due to prior commitments. Aside from the problems that come with buying a cheap case, the build itself actually went pretty smoothly, aside from accidentally applying way too much thermal compound the first time around.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Upon startup, however, more problems arose. Initially I was excited because it turned on, that's always the first step. But then, my graphics card didn't have enough power. No onboard graphics, so while I waited another week for a 2x6-pin to 8-pin adapter, I was once again PC-less.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Aha! Everything is finally booting correctly! I got into the BIOS, and, to my surprise, everything was being detected and was working properly! At least, that's what it looked like. My CPU fan wasn't spinning and my second hard drive wasn't being detected. After some messing around inside the case, the CPU fan was now working, and I just opted to go ahead and install Windows 10 and figure out the hard drive thing later (Windows 10 was going on the SSD).
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Shortly after I had my computer up and running, I figured out the hard drive problem (although I don't even remember what it was now) and I started moving files over, setting up applications, and redownloading everything from my other computer (scrapped my old HDD).
	<br/>
	<br/>
	But only yesterday did I finally activate Windows 10 and gain full access to its features, along with finally cloning this website's repository on this PC, so, now I can officially say...
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Build complete!
