  	For Christmas this year, I asked for a small, cheap, Acer Chromebook to experiment with Linux on, and a few days ago, I started tinkering. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	I started by figuring out how to enable developer mode on Chromebooks. It's pretty simple -- just press Ctrl+D on startup. I'm feeling like a hacker already at this point.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Next, I had to install SeaBIOS, a BIOS made by John Lewis for Chromebooks that allow them to install an operating system other than ChromeOS. This took a couple of tries, and required opening up the computer and removing the "write-protect screw" which took a while to find. After trying to install SeaBIOS multiple times, I realized I was no longer in developer mode since I had to power off the computer to take the screw out, and once I fixed that, SeaBIOS was installed.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	"Now, for the fun part," I thought. I finally got to install the operating system and I would no longer have to deal with that weird ChromeOS terminal. So, I booted up my PC and loaded Ubuntu onto a USB stick using Rufus, a stick writer program that the Ubuntu website recommends. I opened the laptop, booted from the USB through SeaBIOS, and... error.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	I searched around for the error for about 15 minutes before deciding to try Linux Mint instead. "Mint is better anyways," I told myself (which it is, in my opinion, but that's not the point). The point was, I was quick to try something different rather than just fix my problem. Well, it initially seemed to work, because I actually was able to boot into Linux Mint from the USB stick. I started the installer, and all seemed well, until I realized something: the keyboard wasn't working.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	After trying to fix this for much, much longer than any of my other problems, I decided to try an older version. "Hey! The keyboard works! Oh, the trackpad doesn't though..." After another few hours of troubleshooting, I was ready to give up for the night. So, I made a post on reddit asking for some help before going to see a movie with some friends.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	When I got home at around midnight, I saw that I had a reply to my post! "Sounds like GalliumOS is what you're looking for." It was. GalliumOS is a version of Linux that is based on Xubuntu with support for most Chromebook hardware! Bingo! I quickly put in on my USB stick, installed it, and jumped with glee when both the trackpad and the keyboard worked.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	So now I have a cheap little laptop with Linux on it to mess around with, program on, and surf the web on. In fact, I'm writing this post from my Chromebook right now. All I need to complete this thing is a good sticker to cover up the big "Google Chrome" symbol on the front!
