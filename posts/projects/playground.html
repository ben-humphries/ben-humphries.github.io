		Playground is one of the most ambitious projects I've worked on yet: a framework for my future 2D games in SFML. I've implemented animation, level loading and saving, collisions, and other less interesting stuff. I'm still working on this project, but it is suspended right now because I was interrupted by Ludum Dare 40.

		One other cool thing that I'm messing with is the possibility of using shaders in future games. Here's an example of a simple fragment shader:

		This is just a demo state where I'm trying out different things I've implemented. I hope to be able to use this framework to make many more (playable) games in the future!

		Also, the little character I drew is definitely going to be in a future game. He's so adorable! There's definitely potential there.
