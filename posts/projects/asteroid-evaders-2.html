		Welcome to part 2 of <a href="https://ben-humphries.github.io/projects.html#asteroid-evaders">Asteroid Evaders</a>! It is the season of remakes for me! This project started as a way to gain more experience with SFML in a familiar environment, and spiraled into a pit of unreadable, messy code, and implementing new cool stuff while ignoring the unreadable, messy code.

		Obviously, there are problems with this project. You may be able to see from the gif that there isn't a death condition for the player, there are no green asteroids, so the game is basically un-losable, and the asteroid sprite looks like a charred meatball.

		<br/><br/>

		The first game is definitely a lot more fun, but this one gave me the opportunity to make a game from the ground up in C++ and mess with some new concepts like lighting and collision. I think my first game made without Unity is pretty good, although the <u><a href="https://benhumphries.itch.io/asteroid-evaders">first one</a></u> is definitely more fun.
