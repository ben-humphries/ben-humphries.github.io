		FRC stands for First Robotics Competition, and it is a world-wide organization that hosts annual robotics challenges. Each year involves building a robot, and programming it. You can find my team's git repository <u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/frc5160">here</a></u>. Since we only have six weeks to plan, build, and practice with our robot, our drivers are often under-practiced by the time competition comes. To help solve this problem, and to help determine who our drivers will be, I created a simulation that uses the same joysticks or controllers that we use during competitions to emulate what driving the robot is like. With the help of a friend, Vincent Wang, I inserted 3D models of this year's competition field and a model robot. In addition to that, I included some obstacle courses for practice. I hope to expand the simulation into Virtual Reality as I have access to VR equipment.
