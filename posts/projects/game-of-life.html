		I've always been fascinated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, a simple "game" in a grid that is dictated by four basic rules:

		<ol>
			<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>

			<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>

			<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>

			<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
		</ol>

		I decided to recreate my own version of Game of Life to tinker with, so I used Processing (which gave me pretty simple graphics control) to make it. So far the project consists of an on/off toggle and the ability to draw alive and dead cells. Soon I hope to implement a save feature (using .csv files) and maybe even adjustable variables to change the rules of the game. 

		<br/><br/>

		<b>Edit:</b> The save and open feature is now implemented! I did this by saving the grid as a .csv file, plus adding a bunch of tedious UI and string splicing. After adjustable variables I will finally have a good program to tinker with for hours on end!
