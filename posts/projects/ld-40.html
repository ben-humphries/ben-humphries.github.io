		Ethereal is a game where the more light there is, the worse it gets. You play as a poor soul lost in a dark maze, trying to find his way out whilst avoiding ghouls.

		<br/><br/>

		Navigate by increasing the intensity of your light, but beware of light-sensitive enemies. If you retract fast enough, you might just get away.

		Ethereal was my first Ludum Dare game that wasn't made in Unity, and boy, it was a lot of fun. The theme was "the more you have, the worse it gets" and my take on it was light. To progress through the levels, you have to increase the brightness of your light, but there is a trade-off: the brighter your light, the more ghosts you wake.

		I used a lot of similar techniques from Playground to implement things like collision and animation quickly so I could get to the game-making faster. One of the coolest things about Ethereal, and one of the most useful, is the level-loading system. It's different from Playground's, using .png images as levels instead of text files, to make creating them easier (no time for a level-editor in a 48 hour game jam!). Because of my level loading class I was able to make <u>18</u> different levels! It's amazing compared to my 3 levels in Ludum Dare 34.

		<br/><br/>

		The feedback for the game has been very positive so far. There were some things that people didn't like (like the scrolling background) but overall, I think it is the best game I've made. Watching my friends play it in real life, it's just great to see them jump when they get scared! I never thought a 2D game could scare someone like that!
