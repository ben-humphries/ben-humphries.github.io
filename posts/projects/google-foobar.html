	<p>
		A still ongoing project, I am participating in Google's Foo.bar challenge that I was (randomly, I presume) chosen to partake in one day. Each challenge level gives more time and harder questions, and since I completed the first one in late 2015, I've been working on them whenever I don't have any other projects going on.

		I'll probably upload the solutions to the problems (I've saved all problems and solutions I've worked out) to github at some point, so I'll be sure to link it here when I get around to it.
