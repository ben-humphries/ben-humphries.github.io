		Asteroid Evaders was a small project I worked on in order to re-familiarize myself with Unity before starting on the FRC Driving Simulation. It's a small game where you control a spaceship and shoot/dodge asteroids flying past you in order to gain points. Green asteroids give you more points, but reflect your shots back at you at twice the normal speed. Incidentally, combining this mechanic with a growing number of green asteroids (proportional to your score) created a pretty well-balanced game. Some friends discovered a glitch where you get points if two asteroids collide together, but I had already uploaded the game, so I just left it in. Oh well.
