	<p class="permalink">ben-humphries.github.io/posts/projects/bitmap-editor </p>

	<p>
		As a small project, I created a little asset for Unity that allows using a .png file to denote different GameObjects using different colors. The script would read from the image file and, using in-editor information that the user sets, it would instantiate an object or sprite in the correct X,Y, and Z position of the grid in world space. RGB values denoted the type of object, and the A value denoted the z layer.

		<br/><br/>

		I never made a repository for the project as I never really finished or polished it, but if I ever make one it will probably end up <u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/BitmapLevelEditor">here</a></u>.
