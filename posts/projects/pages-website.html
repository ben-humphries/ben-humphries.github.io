		This website is another project inspired by <u><a href="https://pixlark.github.io">pixlark</a></u> who first informed me that it was possible to host a website through Github. I saw this as a great opportunity to document my work and learn some HTML and CSS while doing it, so I've made this simple website to store information about all of my projects, music, blog posts, and code snippets/tutorials on some of the more unique coding strategies I've used.

		If you want to see the newbie HTML that this site is made of, <a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/ben-humphries.github.io">here</a> is the link to the repository.
