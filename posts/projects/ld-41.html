		This weekend I participated in yet another Ludum Dare (I'm starting to lose count!). The theme this time around was "combine two incompatible genres."

		<br/><br/>

		To be honest, I wasn't, and still am not, the biggest fan of the theme. I think the premise of the theme undermines the quality of some of the games I've played and my own game.

		This was definitely the hardest Ludum Dare I've participated in yet, theme-wise, but also motivation-wise. I've been very busy, pretty much since the last game jam, and I haven't had a weekend in months to rest. On top of my exhaustion, my idea was pretty mediocre, and I knew a few hours into programming that the game would be average at best, and probably not very fun.

		<br/><br/>

		Nonetheless, I am proud that I finished another game -- that's the whole point of the Ludum Dare! And some of the games I've been playing on the site are exceptional. This weekend has once again spurred my interest in game programming, and I even have an idea that I'll hopefully be pursuing over the next few weeks.

		<br/>
		<br/>

		Additionally, I'm very happy with the music that I produced this weekend, and I think it is the biggest strength of the game. I might pull the little riffs from the project and develop them further as well.

		The link to the repository is <u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/LD41">here</a></u>, but fair warning, it is probably the worst code I've ever written, so please don't judge me too harshly! I was in a hurry to get it done, and I just didn't have the passion for the project that I normally do to make the code look nice and to make it efficient.

		<br/><br/>

		And here's a bonus -- I recorded my process this weekend and made it into a timelapse! The video isn't the highest of quality, but it was my first time doing it. Hopefully in the future they'll be better, but it's still cool to watch (I think).
