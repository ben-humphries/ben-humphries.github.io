	<p>
		Through the Window was a puzzle game that I made for <u><a href="https://ldjam.com">Ludum Dare 37</a></u>, themed "One Room." I wouldn't say it's my proudest project, as I spent about half of the weekend changing my mind about what I wanted to do and how I wanted to implement it, but nonetheless, it's available for download and to play on <u><a href="https://benhumphries.itch.io/through-the-window">itch.io</a></u>.
