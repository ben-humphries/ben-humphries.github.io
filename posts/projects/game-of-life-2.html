		Welcome to part 2 of <u><a href="https://ben-humphries.github.io/projects.html#game-of-life">Conway's Game of Life</a></u>. I recreated my favorite cellular automaton in C++ this time, using SFML. Using C++, I was able to make big strides in performance by storing and accessing tile states more easily and at relevant times. I also implemented a zoom feature as part of a little SFML exercise since this was my first project with it.

		I plan to put the project on Github soon, but until then you'll just have to admire the gif of Game of Life in action!
