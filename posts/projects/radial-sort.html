		This week I decided to take a break from game programming, which has been my main focus for a while now. Inspired by pixlark's Sorting Algorithm Visualization, I decided to make one of my own, with a personal touch.

		<br/><br/>

		In the examples below, the algorithms are sorting 500 numbers, each represented as a color in the color wheel. This is done in SFML using a TriangleFan object that, with enough triangles, looks like a circle.
		<br/><br/>

		<br/><br/>

		These are only two of the algorithms implemented, Merge Sort and Quick Sort (I think they look the coolest).

		The rest are:
		<ol id="main">
		<li> Selection Sort </li>
		<li> Bubble Sort </li>
		<li> Insertion Sort </li>
		<li> Shell Sort </li>
		<li> Cycle Sort </li>
		<li> Pancake Sort </li>
		<li> Cocktail Sort </li>
		</ol>

		<br/><br/>

		<br/><br/>

		If you want to see the project, it's a single .cpp file <u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/RadialGradientSortTest">here</a></u>.
