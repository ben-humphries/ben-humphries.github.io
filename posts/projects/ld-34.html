		LD34 was my first Ludum Dare (theme "Growth") aside from the Mini LD in which I created my first real game, Vroom!. I'm very proud of the game I created by myself in just 48 hours, since I was very new to Unity and game-making in general at the time. It's so old that if you try to play it in the browser it may not be supported anymore, but there's always the .exe that you can download if you want to try it out. You play as a ball of fire, trying to grow your flames until you have destroyed the entire scene, volunteer firefighers included. To my astonishment, a real firefighter reviewed my game! He said it was "a bit unnerving." If I recall correctly, there's also a 1/100 chance every time a firefighter spawns that it will be a super powerful Bono firefighter.

		If you want to try it out, it's on <u><a href="https://benhumphries.itch.io/pyromaniac-3-2">itch.io</a></u> and the source code is in a <u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/LD34--Pyromaniac-3--2">github repository</a></u>.

		I started work on a Pyro 3D in late 2016 but I never made much progress. Look out for it in the future!
