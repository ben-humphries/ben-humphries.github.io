				<h2> Can We Cut It Out With The Ethereum Mining? -- July 2 2017</h2>

				<p>
					I've been looking to upgrade my PC recently, and possibly the most important part of my upgrade will be the graphics card. I've sorted out pretty much all of the parts I want and am ready to order them, such as the case, motherboard, and SSD/HDD, but the graphics card is giving me a lot of trouble.
					<br/><br/>
					Graphics card prices are inflated, they're on backorder, out of stock... All I see when I go to Newegg is and Auto-Notify button. 
					<br/><br/>
					Now I'm faced with a dilemma: Do I stalk webpages all day in the hopes that eventually a GPU will come in stock, and then buy it for a marked-up price? Or do I wait until the prices go back down and the demand is normal again? 
					<br/><br/>
					But what's the problem in the first place? Why the influx of GTX 1060 and 1070 sales? Ethereum. You may have heard of it. It's the latest and greatest crypto-currency (which is the same type of currency as the wider-known Bitcoin). Ethereum mining algorithms are different from Bitcoin's in that they are most efficient on GPUs, while Bitcoin's algorithms have had their go with GPUs and now have specific "mining" cards that are cheaper and only meant for mining. Anyways, miners are gobbling up 1060s and 1070s in an effort to cash in on Ethereum's up and coming value, which means less for me, and a lot of other PC builders. 
					<br/><br/>
					A lot of forums I've read have said that in a few months, Ethereum algorithms will probably me more efficient on other cards, but at that point I'll be back in school and probably won't have enough time to rebuild the PC. My temporary solution will probably be to upgrade everything but the GPU and do that later when I actually can, as swapping out a GPU shouldn't take more than a few minutes. But dang...
					<br/><br/>
					Cut it out with the Ethereum mining!
