		<h2>Custom Chrome New Tab Page -- June 19 2017</h2>

		<p>
			My custom Google Chrome New Tab Page was inspired by <u><a href="https://pixlark.github.io">pixlark</a></u>, who originally showed me his own custom New Tab Page. I started out by finding basic resources on how to set up an extension that could override Chrome's default New Tab Page. Once I had the .json file ready, I headed into Chrome Extensions and enabled my extension through developer mode. This allowed me to associate a directory on my computer to the New Tab Page. After that, with the help of pixlark, I learned basic HTML and CSS which eventually culminated in a fancy New Tab Page: <br/>

		<h2>FRC Driving Simulation -- May 31 2017</h2>

		<p>
			FRC stands for First Robotics Competition, and it is a world-wide organization that hosts annual robotics challenges. Each year involves building a robot, and programming it. You can find my team's git repository <u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/frc5160">here</a></u>. Since we only have six weeks to plan, build, and practice with our robot, our drivers are often under-practiced by the time competition comes. To help solve this problem, and to help determine who our drivers will be, I created a simulation that uses the same joysticks or controllers that we use during competitions to emulate what driving the robot is like. With the help of a friend, Vincent Wang, I inserted 3D models of this year's competition field and a model robot. In addition to that, I included some obstacle courses for practice. I hope to expand the simulation into Virtual Reality as I have access to VR equipment.

			<br/> <br/>

			<u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/FRC-Driving-Simulation">Here</a></u> is a link to the repository if you want to try out the simulation or use it for your own robotics team. Joysticks recommended (and kinda required)!

		<h2>Asteroid Evaders -- May 29 2017</h2>

		<p>
			Asteroid Evaders was a small project I worked on in order to re-familiarize myself with Unity before starting on the FRC Driving Simulation. It's a small game where you control a spaceship and shoot/dodge asteroids flying past you in order to gain points. Green asteroids give you more points, but reflect your shots back at you at twice the normal speed. Incidentally, combining this mechanic with a growing number of green asteroids (proportional to your score) created a pretty well-balanced game. Some friends discovered a glitch where you get points if two asteroids collide together, but I had already uploaded the game, so I just left it in. Oh well.

			<br/><br/>

			If you want to play the game, check it out <u><a href="https://benhumphries.itch.io/asteroid-evaders">here</a></u>. You can play it in the browser, or download a windows .exe.

		<h2>LD37 Through the Window -- December 10 2016</h2>

		<p>
			Through the Window was a puzzle game that I made for <u><a href="https://ldjam.com">Ludum Dare 37</a></u>, themed "One Room." I wouldn't say it's my proudest project, as I spent about half of the weekend changing my mind about what I wanted to do and how I wanted to implement it, but nonetheless, it's available for download and to play on <u><a href="https://benhumphries.itch.io/through-the-window">itch.io</a></u>.

		<h2>Bitmap Level Editor for Unity -- September ? 2016</h2>


		<p>
			As a small project, I created a little asset for Unity that allows using a .png file to denote different GameObjects using different colors. The script would read from the image file and, using in-editor information that the user sets, it would instantiate an object or sprite in the correct X,Y, and Z position of the grid in world space. RGB values denoted the type of object, and the A value denoted the z layer.

			<br/><br/>

			I never made a repository for the project as I never really finished or polished it, but if I ever make one it will probably end up <u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/BitmapLevelEditor">here</a></u>.

		<h2>Google Foo.bar Challenges -- 2015-Present</h2>

		<p>
			A still ongoing project, I am participating in Google's Foo.bar challenge that I was (randomly, I presume) chosen to partake in one day. Each challenge level gives more time and harder questions, and since I completed the first one in late 2015, I've been working on them whenever I don't have any other projects going on. 

			<br/><br/>

			I'll probably upload the solutions to the problems (I've saved all problems and solutions I've worked out) to github at some point, so I'll be sure to link it here when I get around to it.

		<h2>LD34 Pyromaniac 2--3 -- December 2 2015</h2>

		<p>
			LD34 was my first Ludum Dare (theme "Growth") aside from the Mini LD in which I created my first real game, Vroom!. I'm very proud of the game I created by myself in just 48 hours, since I was very new to Unity and game-making in general at the time. It's so old that if you try to play it in the browser it may not be supported anymore, but there's always the .exe that you can download if you want to try it out. You play as a ball of fire, trying to grow your flames until you have destroyed the entire scene, volunteer firefighers included. To my astonishment, a real firefighter reviewed my game! He said it was "a bit unnerving." If I recall correctly, there's also a 1/100 chance every time a firefighter spawns that it will be a super powerful Bono firefighter. 

			<br/><br/>

			If you want to try it out, it's on <u><a href="https://benhumphries.itch.io/pyromaniac-3-2">itch.io</a></u> and the source code is in a <u><a href="https://github.com/ben-humphries/LD34--Pyromaniac-3--2">github repository</a></u>.

			<br/><br/>

			I started work on a Pyro 3D in late 2016 but I never made much progress. Look out for it in the future!
